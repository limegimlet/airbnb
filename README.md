# Background

(This is a project for the Udacity Data Scient Nanodegree)

Paris is the top city worldwide for Airbnbs. At the same time, it has an extremely tight housing market, both for buyers and renters.

For a number of years, the City of Paris has been trying to stop the flood of short-term rentals by mandating tourist taxes, a registration number, as well as limiting the number of days a dwelling can be rented (> 90 days?)

Pending is a non-binding vote among Parisians on whether to further restrict the number of days to the 20-30 day range. (This vote was scheduled for November 2020 but has been postponed due to the second Covid wave).

More recently, to take advantage of the hollowing-out of the tourist sector as a result of Covid, the City of Paris is offering to lease airbnb properties for 3 years at 20% below market rates.

# Questions

* What proportion of listings comply with the listings?
* How effective have these additional measures been? 

What I'd ultimately like to know, is whether it has improved the ability for locals to afford to rent or buy in Paris? 

This question, however, may be beyond the scope of this initial analysis.

# File descriptions

(Guide others through the files in your repository. You may not talk about every file here, but you should let them know where they can find the work they might find most interesting.(

# How to use these files

(When your project isn't meant to be interactive or used for other projects, you should instead talk about the technical details of your project. What were your results? What did you do to improve them? What methods did you try? What worked? What didn't work?)
